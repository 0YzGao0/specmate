# This is the Specmate UI

## Setup VS Code

Install some extensions to make your life easier:

- Angular (newest version) TypeScript Snippets
- Bootstrap 4 & Font awesome snippets
- NgBootstrap Snippets
- TSLint (from egamma)

## Initialize everything:

- ```npm run init```

To build a dist: ```npm run build```, or Press ```CTRL+B``` in Visual Studio Code, having this folder opened.

To clean: ```npm run clean```

## Structure

All sources are in the folder ```src```. The folder ```webpack``` contains build related files.

### sources

All TypeScript files are contained in the ```app```-folder. Dependent on which kind of functionality is implemented, files go into different folders.

#### config

Here lies only the global configuration of the Specmate-UI.

#### factory

The whole code for creating new objects is here.

#### model

Autogenerated data model classes.

#### modules

The angular components, services, directives and modules.

#### util

Utility functions.

### assets

Go into the ```assets``` folder. Here are also the translation files.

## Build

We use webpack to build the Specmate UI. The build definitions are in the ```webpack```-folder.

Entry points for building the UI are ```main.ts```, ```vendor.ts```, ```polyfills.ts```, ```assets.ts```. 

Typescript files are compiled into specmate, once they are referenced via an import-statement in one of the entry points (or referenced by a file imported into the entry points; transitively).

Assets can be imported either by referencing them in html-files, e.g. images (see index.html; an image is referenced in an ```<img>```-tag; it is automatically included in the build).
